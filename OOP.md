# Abstraction

* emphasis on the idea, qualities and properties rather than the particulars (a suppression of detail)
* emphasis on what an object is or does rather than how it is represented or how it works. [Intro to OOP](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/22769/Introduction-to-Object-Oriented-Programming-Concep)

# Encapsulation

* means that a group of related properties, methods, and other members are treated as a single unit or object. [MSFTDocs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/object-oriented-programming)
* is mainly achieved by creating classes, the classes expose public methods and properties 
* allows a class to change its internal implementation without hurting the overall functioning of the system
* idea is to hide how a class does its business, while allowing other classes to make requests of it [Intro to OOP](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/22769/Introduction-to-Object-Oriented-Programming-Concep)

# Inheritance 

* describes the ability to create new classes based on an existing class. [MSFTDocs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/object-oriented-programming)

# Polymorphism 

* means that you can have multiple classes that can be used interchangeably, even though each class implements the same properties or methods in different ways. [MSFTDocs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/object-oriented-programming)
* the ability to request that the same operations be performed by a wide range of different types of things.
* is achieved by using many different techniques named method overloading, operator overloading, and method overriding. [Intro to OOP](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/22769/Introduction-to-Object-Oriented-Programming-Concep)
